{% docs date_table %}

This table contains date information.

This table is seeded into the demo project because initially a more robust solution was not yet supported for DuckDB.

Now, there is a package which provides lots of functionality to work with dates in dbt.\
Refer to the [dbt_date package documentation](https://hub.getdbt.com/calogica/dbt_date/latest/) for more information.
