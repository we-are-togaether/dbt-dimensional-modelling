## Part 9: Next steps

In this part, we will wrap things up and provide you with some learning resources to further your knowledge on dbt and dimensional modelling.

### Additional challenges

- The CEO of Adventureworks has a change request: he now also want to be able to slice the data by 'sales reason' and 'sales reason category'.
(hint: have a look at the `salesreason` and `salesorderheadersalesreason` seeds). How would you incorporate this into the existing solution?
- An even bigger challenge. AdventureWorks now want to report on their `purchasing process`. Could you add this to the existing solution?
You can find some more information on the source system here: [AdventureWorks source system](https://dataedo.com/samples/html/AdventureWorks/doc/AdventureWorks_2/home.html). 
You will need to add new seeds, staging tables, and dimensional models for this new process.
